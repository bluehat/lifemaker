### These devices are unvetted. 
It is not clear that any healthcare institution will take them.

These objects are being collected here in the hope that we can help facilitate makers and medical professionals collaborating to improve them until at least one healthcare provider is willing to accept them. 

Then the objects can be moved into the site database, so people can start making them and saving lives.
