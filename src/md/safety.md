### Please review the following manufacturing guidelines:

**Your work will be counterproductive and can kill people** if you do not manufacture things safely. Please take these guidelines seriously.
#### You
Do not make any devices if you think you or somebody in your household might be sick or exposed to COVID-19.
Wear a face mask and gloves.
#### Your Workspace
Try to separate your tools and equipment away from people, pets, bathrooms, or food prep surfaces.
Clean before each item is made. Diluted bleach or 70% isopropyl alcohol are good starts.
#### Your tools
##### 3D Printers
The plastic is heated up enough to be considered clean if printed on a clean machine.
#### The things you make
As soon as is safely possible, store the part in a clear plastic bag using gloves or tongs.
One item per bag.
Label the bag with the date you sealed the bag
Don't risk cross contamination by storing objects together.
#### Check what is needed
We are filling in where the broader healthcare system has failed. 
Our advantage is we can respond more quickly than large institutions.
To be part of that quick response, you need to check the website regularly to find out which healthcare providers need what.
#### Liability
These items are not FDA-regulated medical devices. We make no claims regarding their safety or effectiveness in preventing any disease or illness. 

You are voluntarily electing to make and use these objects. By doing so, you are releasing, waiving, and discharging releases from any and all liability, claims demands, actions, and causes of action whatsoever arising out of or related to any loss, damage, or injury, including death, that may be sustained by any individual or organization, while participating in these activities.
#### Thank you
A big thank you to [Get Us PPE](https://getusppe.org/makers/) for writing up clear and high-quality safety protocols, and for letting us iterate from their reccommendations.
