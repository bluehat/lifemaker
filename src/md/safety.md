### Please review our manufacturing guidelines:

**Your work will be counterproductive and can kill people** if you do not manufacture things safely. Please take these guidelines seriously:

- **Do not** make any devices if you or somebody in your household might be sick _or_ exposed to COVID-19 in the past two weeks.
- **Do** wear a mask and gloves while making and handling parts.
- **Do** keep your workspace sterile. Each time you want to make things, clean your space with dilluted bleach, 70% isopropyl alcohol, or other strong cleaners. Don't let other people or pets get it dirty.
- **Do not** attempt to further steralize printed parts. 3D printers heat parts enough that they should be considered clean when they are finished, and strong cleaners can damage them.
- **Do** put finished items in individual sealed bags as soon as possible. Label the bag with the date, and don't put items from different times/days together, since they can cross contaiminate.

Check this site each day when you want to make something. Needs and designs change often!
