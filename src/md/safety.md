### Please review the following manufacturing guidelines:

**Your work will be counterproductive and can kill people** if you do not manufacture things safely. Please take these guidelines seriously.

#### You
Do not make any devices if you think you or someone in your household might be sick.

Act as if you were infected by the COVID-19 virus. 
  - Wear a face mask and a fresh pair of gloves when collecting each device. 
  - Store the devices you make immediately in a sealable bag.

#### Your workspace
If you can, please separate the tools and equipment away from people, pets, bathrooms, or food preparation surfaces.

If you have access to sanitizing solutions, including diluted bleach or 70% alcohol solution, please disinfect your tools and equipment before each item is made.

#### Your tools

##### 3D Printing
If the machine is clean, the plastic is heated up enough to be considered clean once the print is finished.

As soon as it is safe to do so, place the finished part in a clear bag using tongs or gloves.

##### Sewwing
Place each mask in a bag, with one mask per bag.

#### The devices you make
Please write the date the device was made on each bag. The longer something is untouched, the more likely the virus is to die, so knowing how long something has been in a plastic bag is useful.

In order to decrease the risk of cross contamination, do not store the entire stock youâ€™ve made in one place.

#### Improving our efforts
We are filling in where the broader healthcare system has failed. Our advantage is we can respond more quickly than large institutions.

To be part of that quick response, you need to check the website regularly to find out which healthcare providers need what.

#### Liability
These items are not FDA-regulated medical devices. We make no claims regarding their safety or effectiveness in preventing any disease or illness. 

You are voluntarily electing to make and use these objects. By doing so, you are releasing, waiving, and discharging releases from any and all liability, claims demands, actions, and causes of action whatsoever arising out of or related to any loss, damage, or injury, including death, that may be sustained by any individual or organization, while participating in these activities.

#### Thank you
A big thank you to [Get Us PPE](https://getusppe.org/makers/) for writing up clear and high-quality safety protocols, and for letting us iterate from their reccommendations.
