### Please review our manufacturing guidelines:

**Your work will be counterproductive and can kill people** if you do not manufacture things safely. Please take these guidelines seriously.

Do not make any devices if you think that you or somebody in your household might be sick or been exposed to COVID-19 in the past two weeks. Wear a mask and gloves.

Keep your space clean. Don't let other people or pets get it dirty. Each time you want to make things, clean your space with dilluted bleach, 70% isopropyl alcohol, or other strong cleaners.

3D printers heat parts enough that they should be considered clean when they are finished. Don't try to steralize them further, it often damages them.

Put finished items in individual sealed bags as soon as possible. Label the bag with the date. Don't put items from different times/days together, since they can cross contaiminate.

Check this site each day when you want to make something. Needs and designs change often.
