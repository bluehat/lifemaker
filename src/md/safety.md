### Please review the following manufacturing guidelines:
Your work will be counterproductive and can kill people if you do not manufacture things safely. Please take these guidelines seriously.

#### You
First and foremost, please do not attempt to make any devices if you or someone in your household is sick. Even if you have a small tickle in your throat, please do not make any devices if you think you, or someone that you are exposed to may be sick.

Act as if you were infected by the COVID-19 virus. Wear a face mask and a fresh pair of gloves when collecting each device. Store the devices you make immediately in a sealable bag.

This workflow attempts to decrease the chance that any contamination survives to infect a patient or healthcare professional, but the most effective strategy by far is to just not contaminate devices in the first place.

#### Your workspace
If you can, please segregate the tools and equipment that you will be using to make the devices in your space away from people, pets, bathrooms, or food preparation surfaces.

There is still debate about how long the virus survives on hard industrial surfaces, but it is currently estimated that COVID-19 can live on hard industrial surfaces (metal, plastic, and glass) for up to 3 days.

If you have access to sanitizing solutions, including diluted bleach, 70% alcohol solution, or products like Star-San or Odo-Ban, please disinfect your tools and equipment before and after each item is made. 

#### Your tools
##### 3D Printing
If the machine is clean, the plastic is heated up enough to be considered clean once the print is finished.

Do not attempt to sterlize the finished part; just drop it in a clear bag with gloves or tongs and set it aside. Many sterilization solutions will damage PLA, and off-the-shelf isopropyl alcohol is not concentrated enough to properly clean the parts.

Many parts on this site specifically require PETG.

##### Sewwing
Place each mask in a bag, with one mask per bag.

#### The devices you make
Please write the date the device was made on each bag, so that people will know if the device has been sealed away long enough for the virus to die.

If you are delivering items directly to a healthcare provider, you can also let packed items sit for 3 days before distributing, as another mechanism to reduce the risk of transmission.

In order to decrease the risk of cross contamination, do not store the entire stock youâ€™ve made in one place.

#### Improving our efforts
The listings on this site will change over time. Designs will be improved, and eventually larger manufacturing plants will (hopefully) take over the production of a device entirely. If we are extremely lucky, we will even meet the needs of hospitals in an area.

Meanwhile, we plan to manufacture whatever hospitals need but do not have access to at scale yet.

This means it is very important that you check this site often to find out how what you are making and where you are sending it have changed.

If you manage to get feedback on a deisgn, make a new design, successfully test it with the healthcare provider and find out the new design is preferred, please let us know or submit a pull request.

Please also help keep our community up to date with the needs of healthcare providers.

#### Liability
Please note that these are not FDA-regulated medical devices, and have not been manufactured to the same degree of sterility as face masks or other items that directly interface with mucous membranes. We make no claims regarding the safety and efficacy of the PPE in preventing any disease or illness, including, but not limited to COVID-19. 

In utilizing the designs provided, you are voluntarily electing to make the objects described. As such, by participating in this effort, you are releasing, waiving, and discharging releases from any and all liability, claims  demands, actions, and causes of action whatsoever arising out of or related to any loss, damage, or injury, including death, that may be sustained by any individual or organization, while participating in these activities. 

#### Thank you
A big thank you to [Get Us PPE](https://getusppe.org/makers/) for writing up clear and high-quality safety protocols, and for letting us iterate from their reccommendations.
