In light of the dramatic shortage of medical equipment, some healthcare institutions are turning to the maker community for much-needed equipment.

This website attempts to help develop supply chains to formalize and scale this process.

### Directions for different groups

- If you are already delivering devices and want to scale up, [contact us](mailto:makers@lifemaker.org?subject=Scaling%20Production).
- [For makers and maker groups who would like to start making things](./#manufacturing)
- [For healthcare providers](./#devices) who need equipment
- [For website volunteers](./#readme) such as coders, designers, people who aren't afraid to talk on the phone, medical professionals prepared to give feedback on new designs, and technical writers.

### What is going on?
The world is facing a critical shortage of healthcare supplies. All around the world, healthcare providers are turning to new sources for critical supplies. Increasingly, many are turning to makers. 

Makers are groups and individuals who sit at the intersection of DIY culture and hacker culture. They often organize locally as educational nonprofits to create things and teach others about technology. They also often individually create items in their own homes. Increasingly, these facilities and individuals have the capacity to manufacture plastic and cloth items. Many can do metalwork as well.

A space which makers operate communally for educational and manufacturing purposes is generally called a makerspace or a hackerspace. There are more than 2000 active hackerspaces in the world, with membership numbers ranging wildly. Many large spaces have well over a thousand active members, while other spaces are small shops with only a few dozen people. Each maker community is friendly with others, but they rarely share any sort of governance. They are, ultimately, more of a movement than an organization.

All around the world, makers are organizing with their local hospitals and healthcare providers to manufacture and ship them critical supplies for free. However, it is not feasible for every maker to run around calling every hospital asking what they would like.

This is why lifemaker.org exists. Lifemaker.org lists which healthcare providers are requesting what critical supplies, and how to best get those items to the healthcare providers. This work is often done in conjunction with whatever makerspace is closest to the healthcare provider. Local spaces know how to best distribute the devices in their local area. They also can do final assembly of the devices, which lets the remote makers send them in as just components.

We would like very much to understand what healthcare providers need to continue saving lives and help them get those supplies. Please contact us right away if [you are a healthcare provider in need of critical supplies](mailto:healthcare@lifemaker.org?subject=Requesting%20Supplies) or if you [are already delivering critical supplies]((mailto:makers@lifemaker.org?subject=Scaling%20Production) and would like to scale up your production.
