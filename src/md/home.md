Healthcare workers are on the front lines against COVID-19, but are facing critical shortages of basic items required to safely do their work. Increasingly, they are turning to makers. Makers manufacture critical supplies in their own homes and communities.

Lifemaker connects makers with healthcare workers who desperately need these critical supplies.
