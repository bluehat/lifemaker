In light of the dramatic shortage of medical equipment, some healthcare institutions are turning to the maker community for much-needed equipment.

This website attempts to help develop supply chains to formalize and scale this process.

### Directions for different groups

- [For makers and maker groups](./#manufacturing)

- For waypoints (places already working with healthcare professionals and who are interested in getting help from other makers to scale up their manufacturing capacity)
- For healthcare providers who need equipment
- For people who can help with or source supplies to manufacture equipment
- For coordination volunteers who are willing to help introduce and coordinate makers, waypoints, healthcare providers, and suppliers
- [For website volunteers](./#readme) such as coders, designers, people who aren't afraid to talk on the phone, medical professionals prepared to give feedback on new designs, and technical writers.

### Coordination

#### Calls for equipment

- [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/coronavirus/mgh-desperately-needs-supplies-president-says/2094292/) has put out a call for 3D-printed masks. Request is from the hospital president: Dr. Peter Slavin.

#### Individuals who would like to make equipment

Ideally, we will help you coordinate with a broader effort in your geographic community, but for now we're just collecting some form of contact information.

Here is a [google form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QE1vzezYdf6QJwxaMMLrWIks5AYAPUeSRWXxaYd3yK8/edit#gid=587452832) (not affiliated with us) where people with printers are volunteering to help.
