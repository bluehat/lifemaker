In light of the dramatic shortage of medical equipment, some healthcare institutions are turning to the maker community for much-needed equipment.

This website attempts to help develop supply chains to formalize and scale this process.

### Directions for different groups

- If you are already delivering devices and want to scale up, [contact us](mailto:makers@lifemaker.org?subject=Scaling%20Production).
- [For makers and maker groups who would like to start making things](./#manufacturing)
- [For healthcare providers](./#devices) who need equipment
- [For website volunteers](./#readme) such as coders, designers, people who aren't afraid to talk on the phone, medical professionals prepared to give feedback on new designs, and technical writers.

If you have no idea what all of this nerd stuff is about or are struggling to explain this to somebody, check out our [about page.](./#about)
