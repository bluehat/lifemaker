### What is going on?
The world is facing a critical shortage of healthcare supplies. Healthcare providers are turning to new sources for critical supplies. Increasingly, many are turning to makers. 

Makers are at the intersection of DIY culture and hacker culture. They often organize locally as educational nonprofits to create things and teach others. Others participate in online communities and create things in their homes. Increasingly, they can manufacture plastic, cloth, and even metalwork items.

A space which makers operate communally is generally called a makerspace or a hackerspace. There are more than 2000 hackerspaces in the world. Some have over 1000 active members. Each maker community is friendly with others, but they rarely share governance. They are ultimately a movement more than an organization.

During this crisis, makers are organizing with their local healthcare providers to manufacture and ship them critical supplies for free. However, it is not feasible for every member to call every hospital asking what they would like.

This is why lifemaker.org exists. Lifemaker.org lists which healthcare providers are requesting what critical supplies, and how to best get them those items. It also helps healthcare providers request items.

We would like very much to understand what healthcare providers need to continue saving lives and help them get those supplies. Please contact us right away if [you are a healthcare provider in need of critical supplies](mailto:healthcare@lifemaker.org?subject=Requesting%20Supplies) or if you [are already delivering critical supplies]((mailto:makers@lifemaker.org?subject=Scaling%20Production) and would like to scale up your production.
