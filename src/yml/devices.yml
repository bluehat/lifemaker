    These shields use the Swedish frame and are then office supply plastic for the front.  
    Suggested plastic includes a report cover binder or a binder cover.  
    The pegs are measured to work with a standard 3-ring binder punch.  
    The fronts can not be cleaned, but on the upside they don't require a laser cutter.  
    Some hospitals will not use these because they can not be sterilized

    Some places have chosen to not use the shields and just put the patient in a box.  
    This design was developed in Taiwan.  
    Hospitals in the bay area have been using them.  
    They modified them to have [oval arm holes with plastic coverings](https://i.imgur.com/bvYnILS.jpg)
