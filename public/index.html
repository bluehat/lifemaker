      <strong>We're sorry but lifemakers doesn't work
        properly without JavaScript enabled. 
        <br>
        We have been repeatedly and emphatically informed of the irony of this, but this is a do-ocracy, and the person who actually showed up and did the work picked JavaScript. 
        <br>
        Please briefly whitelist lifemaker.org to help address this international emergency. <br> 
        This will help us return to the urgent issue of fighting about languages and tech stacks as promptly as possible.
        <br>
        If you have comments about language or tech stack decisions which absolutely can not wait, please leave them in the commit messages of helpful pull requests.</strong>
