In light of the dramatic shortage of medical equipment, some healthcare institutions are turning to the maker community for much-needed supplies.

This website attempts to help develop supply chains to formalize and scale this process.

You can help make stuff if you have access to any of the following:
* A 3D printer
* A sewwing machine

### How does it work?
1. Individuals who do not have symptoms wear masks and gloves while they manufacture relevant objects in their homes or makerspaces.
1. The items are mailed to a location where they are counted, re-sanitized, checked for quality control, and sent to the healthcare facility.

### Coordination

#### Calls for equipment
* [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/coronavirus/mgh-desperately-needs-supplies-president-says/2094292/) has put out a call for 3D-printed masks. Request is from the hospital president: Dr. Peter Slavin. 

#### Communities already making equipment
* [Maker Nexus of Sunnyvale California](http://makernexuswiki.com/index.php?title=MN_COVID_Response) is manufacturing face masks, face shields, and hospital scrubs.
  * Items are made at home, mailed to the makerspace, and then re-sanitized there.

#### Locations to mail things
* [Maker Nexus of Sunnyvale California](http://makernexuswiki.com/index.php?title=MN_COVID_Response) is accepting and distributing masks, face fields, and hospital scrubs.

#### Communities which would like to make equipment
Educational institutuions welcome

#### Individuals who would like to make equipment
Ideally, we will help you coordinate with a broader effort in your geographic community, but for now we're just collecting some form of contact information.

### Technical bits

#### How to manufacture equipment
[Maker Nexus of Sunnyvale California](http://makernexuswiki.com/index.php?title=MN_COVID_Response) has tutorials for face masks, 3D-printed face shields, and hospital scrubs.

### Help needed for this website
* Making this information more readable than a giant list
* Finding healthcare institutions interested in equipment
* Finding communities interested in making equipment
* Helping upload and organize documentation on how to manufacture equipment
* Manually introducing healtcare institutions and makers
