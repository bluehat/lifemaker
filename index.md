In light of the dramatic shortage of medical equipment, some healthcare institutions are turning to the maker community for much-needed equipment.

This website attempts to help develop supply chains to formalize and scale this process.

### Directions for different groups
* For makers and maker groups who have access to one of the following
  * 3D printer
  * Laser cutter
  * Sewwing machine
* For waypoints (places already working with healthcare professionals and who are interested in getting help from other makers to scale up their manufacturing capacity)
* For healthcare providers who need equipment
* For people who can help with or source supplies to manufacture equipment
* For coordination volunteers who are willing to help introduce and coordinate makers, waypoints, healthcare providers, and suppliers
* [For website volunteers](readme.html) such as coders, designers, and technical writers.

### Coordination

#### Calls for equipment
* [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/coronavirus/mgh-desperately-needs-supplies-president-says/2094292/) has put out a call for 3D-printed masks. Request is from the hospital president: Dr. Peter Slavin. 

#### Communities already making equipment
* [Maker Nexus of Sunnyvale California](http://makernexuswiki.com/index.php?title=MN_COVID_Response) is manufacturing face masks, face shields, and hospital scrubs.
  * Items are made at home, mailed to the makerspace, and then re-sanitized there.

#### Locations to mail things
* [Maker Nexus of Sunnyvale California](http://makernexuswiki.com/index.php?title=MN_COVID_Response) is accepting and distributing masks, face fields, and hospital scrubs.

#### Communities which would like to make equipment
Educational institutuions welcome

#### Individuals who would like to make equipment
Ideally, we will help you coordinate with a broader effort in your geographic community, but for now we're just collecting some form of contact information.

### Technical bits

#### How to manufacture equipment
[Maker Nexus of Sunnyvale California](http://makernexuswiki.com/index.php?title=MN_COVID_Response) has tutorials for face masks, 3D-printed face shields, and hospital scrubs.

### Help needed for this website
* Making this information more readable than a giant list
* Finding healthcare institutions interested in equipment
* Finding communities interested in making equipment
* Helping upload and organize documentation on how to manufacture equipment
* Manually introducing healtcare institutions and makers
