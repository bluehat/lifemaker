In light of the dramatic shortage of medical equipment, some healthcare institutions are turning to the maker community for much-needed supplies.

This website attempts to help makers and healthcare institions find each other.

You can help make stuff if you have access to any of the following:
* A 3D printer
* A sewwing machine

### Coordination

#### Calls for equipment
* [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/coronavirus/mgh-desperately-needs-supplies-president-says/2094292/) has put out a call for 3D-printed masks. Request is from the hospital president: Dr. Peter Slavin. 

#### Communities already making equipment
* [Maker Nexus of Sunnyvale California](http://makernexuswiki.com/index.php?title=MN_COVID_Response) is manufacturing face masks, face shields, and hospital scrubs.
  * Items are made at home, mailed to the makerspace, and then re-sanitized there.

#### Communities which would like to make equipment
Educational institutuions welcome

#### Individuals who would like to make equipment
Ideally, we will help you coordinate with a broader effort in your geographic community, but for now we're just collecting some form of contact information.

### Technical bits

#### How to manufacture equipment
[Maker Nexus of Sunnyvale California](http://makernexuswiki.com/index.php?title=MN_COVID_Response) has tutorials for face masks, 3D-printed face shields, and hospital scrubs.

### Help needed for this website
* Making this information more readable than a giant list
* Finding healthcare institutions interested in equipment
* Finding communities interested in making equipment
* Helping upload and organize documentation on how to manufacture equipment
* Manually introducing healtcare institutions and manufacturing communities
