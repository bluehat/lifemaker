# lifemaker
Makers saving lives

## Help needed for this website
* Making this information more readable than a giant list
* Helping upload and organize documentation on how to manufacture equipment
* Helping automate as much of the coordination as possible, since human coordinators will be limited and introduce latency
* Any sort of design or aesthetic sensibilities whatsoever

Please submit pull requests

lifemaker.org is made using Jekyll.
